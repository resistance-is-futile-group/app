| A01  | As a user I want to compute the resistance value of a picture, in order to simplify the resistor classification process. | BRES | 3    | m    |
| A02  | As a user I want to get the resistance value of my resistor displayed, in order to obtain the results. | BRES | 5    | m    |
| A03  | As a developer I want a local instance of the neuronal network, in order to categorize pictures offline. | BRES | 8    | m    |
| A04  | As a developer I want the user to have the opportunity to donate to the project, in order to support the team. | BRES | 2    | s    |
| A05  | As a user I want to give feedback on the response of the neuronal network, in order to improve its accuracy. | FUCF | 5    | s    |
| A06  | As a user I want to take a picture, in order to process it further. | FUCF | 3    | m    |
| A07  | As a user I want to see an outline of an resistor when I take a picture, in order to improve the quality of the picture. | FUCF | 3    | n    |
| A08  | As a user I want to label a picture, in order to prepare it for the upload. | FUCF | 3    | m    |
| A09  | As a user I want to import a picture from my gallery, in order to process it further. | FUCF | 3    | s    |
| A10  | As a developer I want to synchronize the local instance of the neuronal network with the web service, in order to ensure the highest accuracy locally. | WUSM | 5    | m    |
| A11  | As a user I want to upload a labeled picture, in order to improve the image database. | WUSM | 5    | m    |
| A12  | As a developer I want to publish the application in the Google Play Store, in order to provide it to the public. | WUSM | 3    | m    |
